## Results
(Fill in what you discovered this data could tell you: What I had discovered with this data is that it had contained a very large amounts of products and sales and took some time to clean and filter the data and it had contained some errors, duplicates etc.)
And how you used the data to answer those questions: I had used the data to answer these questions by analysing the data and interpreting the data)

## Future Goals
